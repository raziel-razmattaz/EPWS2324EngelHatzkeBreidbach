section02:
  "Autism Spectrum Disorder—or ASD—is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can manifest itself in a way that affects individuals’ social skills, communication abilities, and behavior patterns. ASD expresses itself on a spectrum, meaning that the severity and symptoms can widely vary from individual to individual. Each person with ASD falls somewhere differently on this spectrum and every case is unique in its own way. Many people with ASD possess unique strengths and abilities, and appropriate support can greatly enhance their performance in the workplace."
  "Your collegues with ASD may often struggle with social interactions, exhibiting challenges in developing and maintaining relationships. They may also have difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication, such as understanding or using expressive language, gestures, or facial expressions. This is why it is important to learn how to best work together!"

section03:
  "One way to categorize the vast differences in experience with ASD, is to use the “Support Level System”. Support levels in the context of ASD refer to a classification system that rates the level of assistance required for individuals with ASD to navigate successfully through various aspects of their life."
  "There are three support levels: Level 1 (requiring a small amount of support), Level 2 (requiring a large amount of support), and Level 3 (requiring a very large amount of support). These support levels are determined based on difficulties in social communication, restricted behaviors, and overall level of (in)dependence. Knowing about support levels allows you to better understand and provide appropriate accommodations for your collegues with ASD."

section05:
  "A person with support level 1 needs often has a relatively mild difficulty with social interactions and communication, which can sometimes result in misunderstandings or difficulties connecting with their colleagues. Most of their struggles in the workplace will likely stem from sensory overstimulation or lack of clear communication."
  "Most autistic people you will meet among your collegues will probably fall under this category."
  "With appropriate workplace accommodations and understanding from you, individuals with level 1 support needs can thrive and integrate easily in the workplace, using strengths like innovative problem-solving, a blunt honesty and fresh, new perspectives to drive productivity. By helping to build an inclusive and supportive environment for your colleague, you can build stronger relationships, bridge communication gaps, and make the workplace a friendlier space for everyone."

  "Some autistic people are diagnosed later in life than others, some even only in adulthood. This does not mean however that someone who is diagnosed later in life would automatically have lower support needs, or someone diagnosed early higher support needs. Autism is difficult to diagnose, and often comes with comorbidties like ADHD which makes diagnosis diffiuclt. Furthermore, childhood trauma can impact how much someone struggles with their autistic symptoms when growing up, or even cause misdiagnosis until much later in life."
  "If a colleague talks about how they were diagnosed well out of early childhood (as is typical), this is not a sign that they don't need substantial support because 'they could manage before'. Please be mindful about what you assume about those around you."

section30:
  "Level of Support Needs is just one way to categorize the autistic experience. Another way of looking at the situation is personal strengths and weaknesses. Many autistic individuals have strong variances in different fields. They might be struggling with language production, but be very good at memorization for example."
  "Of course this is true for the entire human experience, in some way. If you think about your own strenghts and weaknesses, I'm sure you can identify several spectrums on which you'd place yourself at different points. Listening comprehension versus reading comprehension in a foreign language would be a classic example: most people are much better at reading than listening. Their abilities and struggles on these spectrums can vary greatly, even within the same person."
  "Still, Support Levels are a helpfull shorthand for understanding and supporting each other."
  "Most importantly, don't just assume someone can or cannot do something. If someone seems to be struggling with something offer help, but don't simply make uneducated guesses about your coworkers and barge in without consent!"
